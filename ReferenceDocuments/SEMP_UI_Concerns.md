#SEMP UI Concerns

## 4.1 Cyberinfrastructure Requirements

- For the first Marine IO deployment where the OOI Cyberinfrastructure framework and user interface is complete (this is currently scheduled to be the RSN Commissioning Review).
- These requirements and use cases are utilized to develop user screen wireframes in a collaborative environment with the Software Developer, System Engineer, UI Developer, Operator and SME for the target screen.
- The User/Science Screens requirements will lead to an overall updated set of CI requirements including:
  - CyberUser Requirements 
- Operational and Common Requirements.   
  - CI System requirements 
  - CI to Marine IO Interface requirements 
  - CI framework, data management, and user interface.
- Test Plans, Test Procedures, and Test Reports must be numbered and archived according to OOI policy described in the OOI Test and Evaluation Strategy document (1150-00000). 

## 6 User Interface Screen and Vocabulary Update

- OOI Concept of Operations (CONOPS) for the Operational and Maintenance (O&M) phases of the OOI Program along with the Use cases are the basis for User Screen specifications. 
- This OOI CONOPS along with OOI Team will convert the broad CONOPS into a set of OOI Use Cases for both science users and operators. 
  - This has already been performed by the UI team
  - These use cases establish a framework for explicit protocols for the OOI user and operator.  The science users include both the internal and external science focused users of the OOI.  The Operator use cases apply only to the internal OOI personnel.
- The use cases for the Operator are converted into a set of Requirements that will meet the operator and user needs.
  - This was tasked to RPS in a meeting with Project Management, Don, Mike Crowlet, Luke Campbell, and Dan Maher on 8/21/14
  - Completed and submitted by RPS ASA
- These requirements and use cases are utilized to develop User screen wireframes in a collaborative environment with the Software Developer, System Engineer, UI Developer, Operator and SME for the target screen.
 
## 7 Marine Integration Procedure

- User Interaface
  - Integrate into Uframe development environment
- Deliver drivers, parsers, algorithms and UI to Raytheon Omaha
