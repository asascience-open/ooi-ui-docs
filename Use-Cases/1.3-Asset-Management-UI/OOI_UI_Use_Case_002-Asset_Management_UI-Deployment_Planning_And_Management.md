## Definition

## Assumptions

## Scenario
An Operator wants to view the current mission for an asset.
1. Operator navigates to asset management UI.
2. Operator selects desired asset and views the current mission specifications.
3. Operator can also see where the asset is and how far along into the mission the asset is, along with estimated time of completion.
 
An operator want to design a mission for an asset that is yet to be deployed.
1. Operator navigates to asset management UI.
2. Operator selects desired asset that is yet to be deployed. 
3. Operator selects 'plan a mission' and inserts the mission plan (time of deployment, way points, sampling rates, data transmission frequency, etc.).
4. Operator selects 'save'.

## Comments
