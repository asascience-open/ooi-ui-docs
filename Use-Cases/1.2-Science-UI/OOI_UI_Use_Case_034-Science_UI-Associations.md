| Description | User configurable capability to display side by side measurements from different instruments and/or systems for cross comparison. |

##Definition

The system provides the user the ability to display multiple measurements from different instruments and/or systems for cross comparison.

##Assumptions

- Includes visualization of time series, profiles, tracks, images, and other date types.

##Scenario
User wants to display temperature data from different sensors in different locations

 1. User searches for first temperature time series data that they wish to compare.
 2. User selects the "compare" option.
 3. User searches for and selects second timeseries of interest.
 4. System displays the time series overlayed in one graph.
 5. The X and Y Axes can be rescaled if so desired by the user.


User wants to display two different types of data from sensors in the same location.
 1. User searches for first temperature time series data that they wish to compare.
 2. User selects the "compare" option.
 3. User searches for and selects second timeseries of interest.
 4. System displays the time series overlayed in one graph, scaling the y axes as needed.
 5. The X and Y Axes can be rescaled if so desired by the user.
