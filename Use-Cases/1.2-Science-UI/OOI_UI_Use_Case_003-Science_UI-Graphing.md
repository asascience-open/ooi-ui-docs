## Definition
Several different graph types are desired to present data

## Assumptions

## Scenario
A science user wants to create a graph to visualize data.
1. Science user selects the instrument and measurement of concern.
2. Science user selects the type of graph to be created (see [Rutgers PPT](https://github.com/asascience-open/ooi-ui-docs/blob/use-cases/ReferenceDocuments/ocean_gui_visualizations.pptx) for examples)
3. User selects the boundings (time, depth, lat/lon, etc.)
4. User presses plot and is provided with the graph of choice.
5. If a 3d plot, the user may be allowed to rotate and zoom plot (still to be determined).
6. User may save plot as a picture along with the data table.
