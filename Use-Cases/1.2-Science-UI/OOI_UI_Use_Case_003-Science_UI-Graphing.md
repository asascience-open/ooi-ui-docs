## Definition
Several different graph types are desired to present data

## Assumptions

## Scenario
A science user wants to create a graph to visualize data.
1. Science user searches for and selects the instrument and measurement of concern.
2. Science user selects the type of graph to be created from the options provided (see [Rutgers PPT](https://github.com/asascience-open/ooi-ui-docs/blob/use-cases/ReferenceDocuments/ocean_gui_visualizations.pptx) for examples)
3. User selects the boundings for time, depth, lat & lon.
4. User executes the plot and is provided with the desired graph. Individual parameter values are displayed when hovering over the plotted line.
5. User may go back to adjust the boundings for a better fit or scaling.
6. User may save plot as a picture along with the data table.
