# Definition

# Assumptions

# Scenario

- Get the data to the users
- Preferably a common interface like OPeNDAP via ERDDAP AND Thredds
  - ERDDAP has a limited data model that may not fit all the data we have to offer
  - We could even use a custom OPeNDAP service to serve netcdf files
  - Or we could just use thredds
