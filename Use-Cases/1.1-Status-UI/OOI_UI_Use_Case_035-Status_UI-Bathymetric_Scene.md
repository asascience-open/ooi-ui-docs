| Use Case ID | 035 |
| --- | --- |
| Name | Bathymetric Scene |
| Scope of Work | Status UI |
| Actors: | Users, Marine Operators |
| Requester | RSN |
| Description: | Included in the 3d scene should be realistic bathymetric data  |


##Definition

There is a desire for a 3D scene to display Marine assets described in [OOI UI Use Case 011 - 3D Scene Management for Marine Assets](OOI_UI_Use_Case_016-Status_UI-3D_Scene_Management_For_Marine_Assets.md).  Included in this should be realistic bathymetric data based off of bathymetric survey data and the lat/lon of the asset.

##Assumptions :
- Bathymetric data is readily available for all regions that assets are deployed in.

##Scenario

The Marine Operator deploys a moored asset in a known location.  After a few days the asset has drifted.
1. Operator notices a steady drift of a moored asset.
2. Operator opens 3d asset scene.
3. Operator notices that the asset is moving because it is located on a gradient which slopes down in the direction of the prominent wave action.
4. Operator files an action to resolve this issue.
