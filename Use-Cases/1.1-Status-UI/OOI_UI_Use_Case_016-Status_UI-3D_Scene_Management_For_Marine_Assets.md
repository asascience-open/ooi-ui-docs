## Definition

Operators have indicated the benefits for having a 3-dimensional representation
of the marine infrastructure for troubleshooting.  Display a 3D scene for the
marine assets to assist operators in visualizing and quickly identifying faults
in the infrastructure. 

## Assumptions

- Assets have associated 3d models that can be downsampled (reduce vertices from many to few)

## Scenario

The user has a 3D rendering of the marine assets and surrounding area so that
they can identify any possible issues that arise.  The scene includes
information about the health and status of the infrastructure.
