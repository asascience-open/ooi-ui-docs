# Assumptions

# Scenario

- Status screens:
  - Port status and power information
    - Temperature
    - Current
    - Voltage

  - Issue commands to the platforms
  - Port power control
  - Over-current limits
  - Platform state managemnt (doesn't really follow a FSM)
  - Mission Executive
  - Event monitoring and status parameters
    - Status parameters come from the OMS

- Bridge the gap between the platform control and instrument management 
  - Immediately transition to instrument control from a platform/port page

- Port Schedules
- Events
- Network View, so something like the wire-diagram that shows how the network is physically laid out.
