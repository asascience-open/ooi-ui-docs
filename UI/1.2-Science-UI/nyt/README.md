I'm trying the NYT approach on for size.  It's such a pleasant site to browse.  Perhaps I'm trying too sqeeze a round peg into a square hole by tweaking it to fit the science user needs, but so be it.

Notes for PDF.

1. NYT as a template.  The layout implies up-to-dateness, and w/ the graphs in the RH column, it is clear that data is available.

A user is guided to select an array.  Or if they click on a graph, they are taken to that station / paramter page.  Or if a user clicks on an article title, it takes up the whole screen like a normal NYT article would.

2. This is what the stack menu looks like.  It is clear that you can view things by platform or parameter.  Remember, you cannot look at things across arrays.

3. A station page.  The map and the graphs reflect what is selected in the parameters menu.  I suppose if a user had ALL selected and then clicked either a station marker or the station heading, they could look at all sensors for that one station.

4. Clicking on a thumbnail gets them a bigger picture in a modal window.  It is interactive.  And a user can add it to their .My Stations. page.

5. A users .My Stations. page.  You can only look at stations for one array.  I imagine a user could have a .My Stations. master page that would list out each collection by array.

From this page you could select date ranges, manipulate data, and export it.
