Gents, I.m pushing this back out to the class to consider.  Stephen and I spent time poking around at the data, and I have really become attached to the mantra that less is more.  And for this stage of the game, I get the sense that this is a data-driven application more than a mapping application.  But I realize that we need keep a map around for geographic context and perhaps the ability to add model layers when / if that time comes.

Please ignore the colors and the poor man cut-and-paste from several sources, but check out the attachments and see what you think.

I think we need a top-down hierarchy as opposed to a left-right workflow.  You pick a deployment, and stuff changes below it.  You pick a category, stuff changes below it.  But when you make it that far, you are now free to explore.  This follows the COMT model that I think works well.

The om-date attachment shows you the date picker.  If you haven.t already figured it out, this mockup is heavily based on Google analytics.  I think the clean date picker is much MUCH better than a two-thumb time slider.  And w/ something like that, we can clearly indicate what dates are available (once you have picked a deployment, of course).

Once you reach your station view, you can click on a sparkline graph to have it show up in the larger graph area.  It.s responsive to mouseover, etc.  We could consider a click on a sparkline graph an addition to the graph.  So you could plot salinity vs. temperature maybe.

Add-to-cart is next.  I didn.t add that to the mockup, but it needs to be there.  Since users may want to compare obs from one station to another, if we give them the ability to add-to-cart, they can go to a separate page TBD and manipulate the results.

Finally, we could pivot on the sensor as opposed to the station if we so desired.  So once you picked a deployment / category, instead of a list of stations, you could see a list of sensors.  You pick water temperature, and the sparkline graphs are all the water temps from all the sensors.  And the map shows you what sensors are measuring water temp.
